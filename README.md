# CoinMarketCap_Project
 The repository contains the project given by 'AsknBid' company as a test for internship.<br/>
 A Screen of the app called 'CoinMarketPlace' was to be implemented and 'ticker endPoint' was specified for fetching the data from 'Binance Api'
 which gives us stock symbol and price as the response .<br>
 Then the data was to be displayed in a list .<br>
 I have successfully completed the tasks till here and will be working on the following mentioned tasks:<br>
 SORTING: I will add sorting button on the top which will allow the user the sort the list according to price .<br>
 SEARCHBAR : The user will be able to search the desired company from the search bar .<br>
 Many other features like Shimmer Effect , Company Name , Company Image , Graph , 24hr high and low , AddToFavourite etc could not be completed due to limited time but i will surely add these features in future.
